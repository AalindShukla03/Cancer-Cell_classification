# Cancer-Cell_classification

<h2>Objective :</h2>
<p>To classify cancer cells based on their features, and identifying them if they are ‘malignant’ or ‘benign’. We will be using scikit-learn for a machine learning problem. Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning, data mining and data analysis library for Python programming language.</p>

<h2>About the Project :</h2>
<p>In this Python Project, Scikit-learn comes with a few small standard datasets that do not require downloading any file from any external website. The dataset that we will be using for our machine learning problem is the Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. The dataset includes several data about the breast cancer tumors along with the classifications labels, viz., malignant or benign.</p>

<h2>Dataset :</h2>
<p>The data set has 569 instances or data of 569 tumors and includes data on 30 attributes or features like the radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc. of a tumor. We will be using these features to train our model.</p>
<h2>Additional Python Libraries Required :</h2>
<ul>
  <li>scikit-learn</li>
  
       pip install scikit-learn
</ul>
<ul>
 <li>jupyter</li>
  
       pip install jupyter
</ul>

<h2>Step by step implementation of classification using Scikit-learn :</h2>
 <ul>
  <li># importing the Python module
import sklearn

# importing the dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
</li>
  
      python detect.py --image <image_name>
</ul>
  <p><b>Note: </b>The Image should be present in same folder where all the files are present</p> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Detecting Gender and Age of face through webcam</b> Use Command :</li>
  
      python detect.py
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Press <b>Ctrl + C</b> to stop the program execution.</li>
</ul>
